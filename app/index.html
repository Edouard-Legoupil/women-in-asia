			<p>To succeed in western business or politics today, one need only mention the word "Asia" as frequently as possible. If unsure what to say about the region, an otherwise confident upstart can cope simply by accusing rivals of being too slow to adapt to a world in which Asia will hold many more cards than it used to.</p>

		<p>Economic figures seem to legitimate the obsession with Asia. China is poised to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-21/china-to-overtake-u-s-as-largest-trading-nation-hsbc-says.html">overtake the US</a> as the world's largest trading nation in 2016. Asian countries sit atop rankings of everything from <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports-downloads/2012/global-consumer-confidence-q2-2012.html">consumer confidence</a> to <a href="http://www.oecd.org/pisa/46643496.pdf">educational performance</a> (PDF).</p>

		<p>Yet even as Asian countries catch up to the dominant powers of yesterday across a host of national-level statistics, internally one group of people has been left behind. Making up at least half the population, this group is, needless to say, women.</p>

		<p>What follows is an in-depth look at the status of women across Asia, with an emphasis on looking at important statistics. The map below serves as a quick reference for readers. Throughout the article, clicking on the name of a country will bring you back to the map, giving you a nation's location and essential figures. (Try it out, for example, with <a id="one" href="#map">South Korea</a>.)</p>

		<p>Many will contend that attempting to say anything meaningful about "Asia" -- home to well over half of the earth's population -- is a hopeless endeavor. The same goes for "women", an equally diverse and therefore meaningless category. I agree. And the diversity of the statistics presented here points to the error of having a discussion in such sweeping terms. Nevertheless, only through applying these abstract concepts are we able to see that the meteoric economic rise of Asia has been unequal, and that these disparities need to be addressed.</p>

		<div class="sections" id="sec3">
			<p>First, the good news. While many commentators are quick to assume that unequal education is holding women back, Asian girls have largely caught up to boys in this vital area. The task set to developing countries by the UN's Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is to: "eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education, preferably by 2005, and in all levels of education not later than 2015".</p>

			<p>This has been achieved outright in East Asia, where the number of girls for every 10 boys in primary and secondary school has risen from just under 8.5 to almost 10.3 in the 20 years since 1983, according to the World Bank. There is more work to be done in South Asia, but the figure there has leapt from 6.24 to 9.5. On this indicator many Asian nations now perform alongside or above their counterparts in the OECD, a group of mostly developed countries, despite the former group's relatively low incomes. In <a id="two" href="#map">China</a>, the ratio was measure at 9.1 girls for every 10 boys in 1991, compared to 10.3 today. The rate for <a id="three" href="#map">India</a> saw an even more dramatic expansion in that time period, from 7.6 girls to 10.</p>

			<p>Clicking between "Primary" and "Secondary" on the following chart, which measures the most recent data on the ratio of girls to boys in school, shows that the median level for Asian countries lies around the OECD average.</p>

			<a><span class="eduControl">Secondary</span></a>
			<a><span class="eduControl">Tertiary</span></a>
			</div>
		 </div>
		</div>
	<div class="sections" id="sec4">
		<p>But select "Tertiary" and a different picture emerges. In <a id="4" href="#map">Bangladesh</a> there are just 61% as many women as men in college-level education, as of 2009. This statistic also reveals the fact that high levels of economic growth do not translate to equal status for women: two of the poorest performers are wealthy <a id="5" href="#map">South Korea</a> (72%) and <a id="6" href="#map">Japan</a> (89%), while relatively poor <a id="7" href="#map">Sri Lanka</a> does well (192%). Sri Lanka's success in this area is in part the result of there being fewer jobs available to women in the first place, necessitating a need for further education. But if anything this points to the amount of work that needs to be done in countries like <a id="8" href="#map">Laos</a> (77%), <a id="9" href="#map">Cambodia</a> (53%) and <a id="10" href="#map">Nepal</a> (40%), and indeed Japan and South Korea, where women can neither find work nor continue into higher education.</p>

		<p>That an important goal set by an international body has largely been met is no doubt inspiring. Yet disturbingly, democratizing access to education has had little impact on other measures of gender equality. As we will see in the next section, attitudes about women in many parts of Asia remain a stubborn obstacle to their being able to apply equally the skills and knowledge they have acquired through increased education.</p>
