			<p>To succeed in western business or politics today, one need only mention the word "Asia" as frequently as possible. If unsure what to say about the region, an otherwise confident upstart can cope simply by accusing rivals of being too slow to adapt to a world in which Asia will hold many more cards than it used to.</p>

		<p>Economic figures seem to legitimate the obsession with Asia. China is poised to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-21/china-to-overtake-u-s-as-largest-trading-nation-hsbc-says.html">overtake the US</a> as the world's largest trading nation in 2016. Asian countries sit atop rankings of everything from <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports-downloads/2012/global-consumer-confidence-q2-2012.html">consumer confidence</a> to <a href="http://www.oecd.org/pisa/46643496.pdf">educational performance</a> (PDF).</p>

		<p>Yet even as Asian countries catch up to the dominant powers of yesterday across a host of national-level statistics, internally one group of people has been left behind. Making up at least half the population, this group is, needless to say, women.</p>

		<p>What follows is an in-depth look at the status of women across Asia, with an emphasis on looking at important statistics. The map below serves as a quick reference for readers. Throughout the article, clicking on the name of a country will bring you back to the map, giving you a nation's location and essential figures. (Try it out, for example, with <a id="one" href="#map">South Korea</a>.)</p>

		<p>Many will contend that attempting to say anything meaningful about "Asia" -- home to well over half of the earth's population -- is a hopeless endeavor. The same goes for "women", an equally diverse and therefore meaningless category. I agree. And the diversity of the statistics presented here points to the error of having a discussion in such sweeping terms. Nevertheless, only through applying these abstract concepts are we able to see that the meteoric economic rise of Asia has been unequal, and that these disparities need to be addressed.</p>

			<h1>Education</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="sections" id="sec3">
			<p>First, the good news. While many commentators are quick to assume that unequal education is holding women back, Asian girls have largely caught up to boys in this vital area. The task set to developing countries by the UN's Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is to: "eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education, preferably by 2005, and in all levels of education not later than 2015".</p>

			<p>This has been achieved outright in East Asia, where the number of girls for every 10 boys in primary and secondary school has risen from just under 8.5 to almost 10.3 in the 20 years since 1983, according to the World Bank. There is more work to be done in South Asia, but the figure there has leapt from 6.24 to 9.5. On this indicator many Asian nations now perform alongside or above their counterparts in the OECD, a group of mostly developed countries, despite the former group's relatively low incomes. In <a id="two" href="#map">China</a>, the ratio was measure at 9.1 girls for every 10 boys in 1991, compared to 10.3 today. The rate for <a id="three" href="#map">India</a> saw an even more dramatic expansion in that time period, from 7.6 girls to 10.</p>

			<p>Clicking between "Primary" and "Secondary" on the following chart, which measures the most recent data on the ratio of girls to boys in school, shows that the median level for Asian countries lies around the OECD average.</p>

			<a><span class="eduControl">Tertiary</span></a>
			</div>
		 </div>
		</div>
	<div class="sections" id="sec4">
		<p>But select "Tertiary" and a different picture emerges. In <a id="4" href="#map">Bangladesh</a> there are just 61% as many women as men in college-level education, as of 2009. This statistic also reveals the fact that high levels of economic growth do not translate to equal status for women: two of the poorest performers are wealthy <a id="5" href="#map">South Korea</a> (72%) and <a id="6" href="#map">Japan</a> (89%), while relatively poor <a id="7" href="#map">Sri Lanka</a> does well (192%). Sri Lanka's success in this area is in part the result of there being fewer jobs available to women in the first place, necessitating a need for further education. But if anything this points to the amount of work that needs to be done in countries like <a id="8" href="#map">Laos</a> (77%), <a id="9" href="#map">Cambodia</a> (53%) and <a id="10" href="#map">Nepal</a> (40%), and indeed Japan and South Korea, where women can neither find work nor continue into higher education.</p>

		<p>That the laudable goal of achieving equality in education has largely been met is inspiring. Yet disturbingly, democratizing access to education has had little impact on other measures of gender equality. Indeed, variation increases dramatically from primary to tertiary education, with many countries falling far below the OECD average of just under 1.3 girls for each boy for the highest level. This suggests that while Asian women are learning more, they are not treated on equal footing at the higher levels of society.</p>

        <p>As we will see in the next section, attitudes about women in many parts of Asia remain a stubborn obstacle to their being able to apply the skills and knowledge they have acquired through equalization of early education.</p>

			<h1>Attitudes</h1>
		</div>

	<div class="sections">
		<p>Girls in Asia are learning more than ever and have lived in the area home to the fastest economic growth seen in human history. Despite these gains, they remain disproportionately out of positions of influence (see "Representation" section below) and are in general less able to become empowered, capable agents. In his book <em>Development as Freedom</em>, Amartya Sen called poverty "a deprivation of basic capabilities". According to this logic, women in Asia are overall more impoverished than men, facing institutional and social barriers to exercising their capabilities. How to explain this fact, given the rapid growth of Asia?</p>

        <p>One explanation is attitudes. Compared to other regions of the world -- parts of the Middle East being an exception -- Asian society puts women on unequal footing with men.</p>

        <h2>Perceptions: Better, but bad</h2>

        <p>The chart below shows the results of three separate surveys on views of women, carried out by the <a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/">Pew Global Attitudes Project</a> in 2010. While only 20 countries were included in the survey, the largest and most influential nations from each part of the world are represented. (Those from Asia -- China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan and South Korea -- together make up of three-quarters of the continent's total population.)</p>

        <p>Pew asked random population samples from each country about women's capability to serve as politicians, whether they have a right to work when jobs are scarce, and whether they should be able to work outside the home at all. The Asian countries are highlighted below in red. (Please note that survey results do not always add up exactly to 100%, hence the uneven bars.)</p>

	<div class="sections">
		<p>Some of the discrepancies here are quite dramatic, especially Asian countries are compared to their western counterparts. In India and Pakistan over half of those surveyed responded "completely agree" that "men should have more right to a job than women" when jobs are scarce. It was around or above a quarter of respondents for China, Indonesia and South Korea. For context, "completely agree" only made up 4% of responses in Britain, Germany and the US for this question. The gap grows even wider when "completely agree" and "mostly agree" are taken together.</p>

        <p>The trends are less clear for the other two questions. When asked about women's ability to serve as political leaders, India registered the <em>highest</em> figure for of those saying that women are in fact better politicians, following its tradition of strong female leaders, including Sonia Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee. While Mao Zedong famously announced that "women hold up half the sky", they only hold up 23% of the Chinese Communist Party, <a href="http://www.cfr.org/china/chinese-communist-party/p29443">according to the Council on Foreign Relations</a>. And only 4% of Chinese respondents said women make better political leaders than men, with 28% saying the opposite. With the exception of Japan, western and Latin American countries are more likely than Asian ones to say that men and women make equally good politicians.</p>

        <p>Finally, the results for the question about women working outside the home appears to implicate almost everyone. Shockingly, Brazil, Britain and the US were only nations to have 80% or more respondents saying they "completely agree" that women should work outside the home (Germany is close). Like in the other surveys, East Asian countries and India perform better worse than counterparts in Latin America and the west, but better than those of the Middle East. This is not true of Pakistan and Indonesia -- presumably for religions reasons -- which look more like Egypt and Jordan.</p>

        <h2>Sex ratios: Asia's 'missing girls'</h2>
        <p>Mara Hvistendahl called it "unnatural selection" in <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11467568-unnatural-selection">her book</a> of that title. The subtitle is more revealing: "Choosing Boys over Girls and the Consequences of a World Full of Men". What Hvistendahl's book and a number of other reports describe is the wildly distorted proportions of men to women, or sex ratios, in Asia.</p>

        <p>Biologically, the figure should be 105 boys for every 100 girls at the time of birth. (Women live longer, so this ratio leads to a more or less 50:50 breakdown of a population's sex.) But in Asia, these figures are unnaturally tilted in favor of boys. Given what we have just seen with respect to attitudes toward women in society, it is not surprising that families would prefer sons to daughters. It might come as a surprise, however, that this preference manifests itself in such horrors as sex-selective abortion and the killing of female babies. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/15606229">Over 100m girls</a> are thought to have "disappeared" this way.</p>

        <p>You can explore these distortions with the interactive chart on sex ratio data. It visualizes data on 12 Asian countries with distorted ratios, extrapolating from 2010 World Bank data to estimate the number of girls that went "missing" that year. Also, it depicts the number of girls that are absent in the figures given the biological ratio of 105 boys for every 100 girls.</p>
